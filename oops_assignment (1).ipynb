        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of object-oriented Programming (OOPs) or oops concepts in Python is to bind the data and the functions that work together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. For more in-depth knowledge in Python OOPs concepts, try GeeksforGeeks Python course, it will gives you insights of Python programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Inheritance**\n",
        "A class can inherit features and methods from another class. This promotes code reusability and logical structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
        "* It provides the reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
        "* It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Inheritance\n",
        "* Single Inheritance: Single-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit characteristics from a single-parent class.\n",
        "* Multilevel Inheritance: Multi-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from an immediate parent class which in turn inherits properties from his parent class.\n",
        "* Hierarchical Inheritance: Hierarchical-level inheritance enables more than one derived class to inherit properties from a parent class.\n",
        "* Multiple Inheritance: Multiple-level inheritance enables one derived class to inherit properties from more than one base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Encapsulation**\n",
        "Restricts access to methods and variables to protect data from direct change. Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Abstraction**\n",
        "Hides all but the relevant data about an object to reduce complexity and increase efficiency. It hides unnecessary code details from the user. Also,  when we do not want to give out sensitive parts of our code implementation and this is where data abstraction came.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Abstraction in Python can be achieved by creating abstract classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Classes and objects**\n",
        "A class is a blueprint used to develop objects.A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods.\n",
        "* Classes are created by keyword class.\n",
        "* Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.\n",
        "* Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator.Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "Myclass.Myattribute\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class and has its own set of properties. In object oriented programming Python, The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects. More specifically, any single integer or any single string is an object.\n",
        "An object consists of:\n",
        "\n",
        "* State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object. State or Attributes can be considered as the breed, age, or color of the dog.\n",
        "* Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects. The behavior can be considered as to whether the dog is eating or sleeping.\n",
        "* Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects. The identity can be considered as the name of the dog.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Polymorphism**\n",
        "It is a central feature of OOP. Polymorphism simply means having many forms. For example, we need to determine if the given species of birds fly or not, using polymorphism we can do this using a single function."

        "\n",
        "Method Resolution Order(MRO) it denotes the way a programming language resolves a method or attribute. Python supports classes inheriting from other classes. The class being inherited is called the Parent or Superclass, while the class that inherits is called the Child or Subclass. In python, method resolution order defines the order in which the base classes are searched when executing a method. First, the method or attribute is searched within a class and then it follows the order we specified while inheriting. This order is also called Linearization of a class and set of rules are called MRO(Method Resolution Order). While inheriting from another class, the interpreter needs a way to resolve the methods that are being called via an instance. Thus we need the method resolution order.\n"
